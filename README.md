## How to build a PC >by Austin Parrish,<br> Student - University of Missouri, Columbia

### In this tutorial I will go thorugh the parts that are necessary to build a computer...

<h5>In order for me to easily demonstrate this I will be using a website called www.pcpartpicker.com</h5>

<p>The reason I am making this tutorial is for anyone that might be in the market for building their first PC. I recently built my first PC in the spring of 2018. I utilized the pcpartpicker website. It greatly enabled me to choose the parts that I needed with ease. Especially in knowing that all of my parts were going to be compatable within the build.</p>
